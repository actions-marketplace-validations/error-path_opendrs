// The heavier real-git-repo and CPU-bound integration tests (git-spawn fixture cost + model
// fits), split out of the default `npm test` so local iteration isn't gated on all of them.
// `npm run check` and CI run both configs, so total coverage is unchanged — see docs/maintaining.md
// "Dev loop metrics" and docs/research/2026-10-22-dev-loop-time-sinks.md for how this list was chosen
// (every file that took >= 20s in a full `vitest run --reporter=json` measurement).
